				Hello!
			</p>
			<p>
				My name is Rick Myers and I am a growing network administrator/engineer with quite a bit of technician
				experience. Some of my transferable skills from previous work also include client-facing negotiations, coordination between a 50+ client 
				portfolio, conflict resolution, and the ability to manage multiple priorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have always enjoyed tech; built my own computers, networks, 
and honestly enjoy "figuring it out." My Linux chops are solid, I am comfortable with
AAA and the side of my desk is stacked with old Catalyst switches and routers which I 
clearly have not wanted to get rid of yet :) I use GNS3 for labs, and plan on moving to an eve-ng/ESXi setup soon. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Over the last 3-5 years, I have been subcontracting with Liza Morse of RCRS in
Alameda, as well as holding the Management slot at Speisekammer until March 15th
when the Covid-19 lockdown was implemented. I would be more than happy to give
additional details on the scope of work for various projects in person or on the
phone/zoom, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
Long story short; I'm looking for a great company to give me a chance, as I level up from where I am at currently.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hold three networking certifications (Network+, CCENT, CCNA) and an AWS Cloud Practitioner as well. I've also been studying python for network automation
since 3/20. I am currently working on a Network Operations & Security, B.S. on the weekends/evenings 
concurrently with my CCNP ENCORE and Windows Server studies.
			</p>
			<p>	
This is all self-study, so as you can see I'm motivated. :) 
			</p>
			<p>
That being said, I hope this finds you all well and I look forward to connecting!
			</p>

			Morning!
			</p>
			<p>
Someone suggested I start a blog for studies and projects. It's a good idea, and I'll move these posts to the website soon enough. Spoke with an SP last week so I'm lightly reviewing Metro-E, MPLS, and some Segment Routing (IOS-XR7 looks like a nice upgrade). Waiting to hear back. Clearly, if something real comes up I'll re-prioritize but I'll always be studying I think :) Decided to start posting the links to my class notes (Evernote), if that helps anybody, see below. CCNA R/S Core kicking into gear now.

			<p>
1) Cisco 350-401 - Finished Hierarchical Network Model section, almost done with Ent. Network Design, and should get through High-Availability Techniques today. Pretty much all review, but going through anyways.
			</p>
			<p>
2) Labs - Actually did some IPv4 subnetting review yesterday. It was fun. Basic DHCP/OSPF as well.
			</p>
			<p>
3) Some General Ed. - English - Halfway through the class. Progress is improving. The goal is one class every 30 days and I'm about 1.5-2x that atm.
